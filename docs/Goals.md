# Goals
## Name
Come up with a name for me for a coding project?  The goal will be able to allow people to log in and "adopt" a farm animal.  The first animals we will have are chickens.  People will be able to adopt and name them.  There will be a chicken profile, it's date of hatching, picture, weight, age, what it is fed, so that it can be monitored remotely and the adopted "parent" can blog about the chick.  We will tell what type of feed is being used, the living conditions (temp at the farm), and the weight and height, feather color, genealogy of the chicken.  What are 10 creative names for a web app like this.
